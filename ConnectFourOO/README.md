# Connect Four

A project used to exercise skills in JavaScript, CSS, and DOM Manipulation. I was first given a basic code base and required to refractor using ES2015 standards. After bringing the code up to date, I used CSS and JavaScript to make it come alive. Creating Javascript functions to initialize the baord, alternate between players, assign player piece colors and end the game.
